Pilgrims, I come to you a broken man. Nine days I lived out there, in the sun, baked to a crisp like the little potato piggy I am. My crew left me stranded without my boat. The barge I called home tried to sink from a massive leak. A man with a live chicken on his head launched me into the water from a pneumatic catapult. It was terrible, and awesome. And damp. Gather round, pilgrims, for a story that ends with a call for your help

....or actually, don't. Not here anyway. If you want to know the long (but true) story of how we got here, go join me in [#mr-cwalkers-wild-ride](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C02AWNTDXUH). For this announcement I'll cut to the chase:

**Hack Club needs a navy.**

We need hundreds of vessels built from scrap and gumption by teenage hackers all around the world. I don't know how we're going to do it exactly. Maybe a contest? Or a grant program? I'm not sure. Here's what I'm sure of though:

**Navies need flags.**

In about 2 months a crew of hackers will drive a floating bouncy castle into the water outside [Maker Faire](https://makerfaire.com/). As we speak, we are gathering teenagers to engineer systems for electric propulsion, solar power, and remote control in [#operation-castle](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C05N8L804KW). Why? Because the bouncy castle is the flagship of the Hack Club Naval Armada. And a flagship needs a flag. Therefore:

**Hack Club needs a flag referendum.**

It worked for [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%932016_New_Zealand_flag_referendums). And the [Hello Internet](https://podpedia.miraheze.org/wiki/Hello_Internet_flag_referendum) guys. Join us in [#flag-referendum](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C05MQDSPASH) today to rally support for your design and deliberate over our beloved future flag. The winner will fly from the floating bouncy castle at Maker Faire, from the flagpole at HQ, and eventually from every vessel in our nascent global armada.

**The flag vote begins on September 18th, so submit your design ASAP!**

Let's hop to it, pilgrims.\
