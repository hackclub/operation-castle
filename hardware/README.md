# Hardware

Currently there exists a bouncy house that can float but it is powered by dinosaur remains. We want it to be powered by electrons and the glourious sun...a plant.

## Requirments
- RGB Lights - enough to be brightly visble on the water[^1]
- Electrical motors - enough to make the boat go vrooommmmm
- Internet control - anyone can log onto a web page and drive the boat around
- Solar panels - the castle is self-sustaining
- Audio - music equpiment + musical car horns (GTA)

[^1]: Note the vagueness of each of these requirments. We can set concrete defintions later on.

### Open-ended questions:
- How are we connecting the raspberry pi to the internet? We're in the middle of a river.
- How do we string LEDs around the castle? What animations do we want?
- How much power is the entire boat going to suck?
- How fast can we go (mass of boat, power of motors)
